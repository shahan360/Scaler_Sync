Problem Name: Q3. Serialize Binary Tree

## Problem Description

Given the root node of a Binary Tree denoted by A. You have to Serialize the given Binary Tree in the described format.

Serialize means encode it into a integer array denoting the Level Order Traversal of the given Binary Tree.

NOTE:

In the array, the NULL/None child is denoted by -1.
For more clarification check the Example Input.

Problem Constraints

1 <= number of nodes <= 105

Input Format

Only argument is a A denoting the root node of a Binary Tree.

Output Format

## Example Output

Output 1:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
Output 2:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

Example Explanation

## Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

The Level Order Traversal of the given tree will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
Since 3, 4 and 5 each has both NULL child we had represented that using -1.

Explanation 2:

The Level Order Traversal of the given tree will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -1, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1].
Since 3 has left child as NULL while 4 and 5 each has both NULL child.
